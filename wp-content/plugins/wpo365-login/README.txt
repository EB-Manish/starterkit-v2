== Changelog ==

= v23.1 =
* Fix: The plugin update checker did not always return the expected result. [LOGIN, MS GRAPH MAILER]

= v23.0 =
* Change: The WPO365 | M365 APPS extension now includes the Gutenberg Editor Block to embed a SharePoint Document Library in WordPress (was previously sold as a separate extension called WPO365 | DOCUMENTS). [M365 APPS, DOCUMENTS]
* Improvement: An administrator of a website that receives OpenID Connect based ID tokens from multiple sources, can now configure the plugin to ignore ID tokens not issued by a Microsoft Azure AD based Identity Provider. [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: A new (translatable) error message - for the case where the ID token is intended for a different audience - has been added. [LOGIN]
* Improvement: The **Documents** (shortcode and Gutenberg based) app - to embed a SharePoint library in WordPress - can now be configured to show / hide an "Open in SharePoint" link in the app's header. [M365 APPS, DOCUMENTS, INTRANET]
* Improvement: The WPO365 authentication cookie (set when you configure an "auth.-only" authentication scenario) can be prefixed to help work-around server-side caching services / plugins that support naming convention based cache busting. [LOGIN]
* Improvement: 3 new developer actions for wpo365/oidc/authenticating, wpo365/saml/authenticating and wpo365/user/creating have been added. See the [updated documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/82-developer-hooks) for details. [LOGIN]
* Fix: If certain conditions were met, the plugin would delete "Audience" related metadata unwantedly. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: A SAMLResponse sent to the website will only be processed if the administrator configured SAML 2.0 based SSO for WordPress. [LOGIN]
* Fix: Various modifications to **Microsoft Graph Mailer** configurator should make it easier and more intuitive to configure it. [LOGIN, MS GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: Exceptions logged by the **Microsoft Graph Mailer** are earmarked when logged in ApplicationInsights with a new custom property "wpoMail". Administrators can now configure a query-based alert in ApplicationInsights and trigger a new alert specifcally for mail-related errors if "wpoMail" equals "error". [LOGIN, MS GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: The **Documents** (shortcode and Gutenberg based) app - to embed a SharePoint library in WordPress - will now correctly load items in a folder. [M365 APPS, DOCUMENTS, INTRANET]
* Fix: The **Documents** (shortcode and Gutenberg based) app - to embed a SharePoint library in WordPress - now accepts a pagesize parameter to improve the performance when loading large libraries. [M365 APPS, DOCUMENTS, INTRANET]
* Fix: The **Documents** (shortcode and Gutenberg based) app - to embed a SharePoint library in WordPress - now loads all possible "locales" so it can display date columns e.g. "Modified" correctly. [M365 APPS, DOCUMENTS, INTRANET]
* Fix: The Log Viewer - to view and optionally resend emails sent using the Microsoft Graph Mailer - now calculates the last inserted logged item ID using MAX() instead of looking up the AUTO INCREMENT value, which may not be up-to-date. [MAIL] 
* Fix: In an attempt to prevent the error "cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 15001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received" when integrating with Microsoft Graph, the use of the Expect: header has been disabled by default. [LOGIN, MS GRAPH MAILER] 
* Fix: If support for multi-tenancy has been enabled and a user with a personal Microsoft account (e.g. outlook.com) signs in successfully, the plugin will no longer attempt to connec to Microsoft Graph to retrieve additional user attributes. [LOGIN+, CUST. USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: The license checker (for premium extensions / bundles) has been updated to work-around an issue whereby the license would be invalidated if the website's home URL would incidently returned the site's IP address instead of its host name. This might happen occassionaly, if you defined the constant WP_HOME using the $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] variable in your wp-config.php file and the site was requested by its IP address instead. [LOGIN]
* Version bump for all extensions and bundles

= v22.1 =
* Fix: The built-in Microsoft Graph Mailer for WordPress will now exclude any custom headers that do not start with x- or X-, to prevent Microsoft Graph from not sending the message and reporting the following error instead: "The internet message header name [...] should start with 'x-' or 'X-'.". [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]

= v22.0 =
* Improvement: Administrators can now define **configuration overrides in the WP-Config.php** file. Support for *configuration overrides* must be enabled separately by checking the correspondig option on the plugin's *Miscellaneous* page. See [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/172-use-wp-config-php-to-override-some-config-options). [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: The plugin will no longer skip loading when detecting **wp-cli** but instead skip any attempt to authenticate the current request. Support for wp-cli must be enabled separately by checking the correspondig option on the plugin's *Miscellaneous* page. See [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/173-skip-authentication-for-wp-cli). [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Administrators can now define a list of usernames of administrators that are allowed to administer the WPO365 settings in the WP-Config.php file. See [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/174-restrict-access-to-the-wpo365-configuration-pages). [LOGIN]
* Improvement: The WPO365 | MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER plugin can now also log remotely to **ApplicationInsights**, allowing administrators to configure **Azure's Monitoring / Alerts** feature e.g. to send an SMS when ever an exception is logged. [MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: Updated the permissions requested / scope for **Azure AD B2C / OpenID Connect** based Single Sign-on, after a previous change added 'https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read' to the scope / permissions being requested (v21.8), which in turn caused an "invalid_request AADB2C90146" response being returned when attempting to authenticate with Microsoft. [LOGIN]
* Fix: Updated the permissions requested / scope for **Azure AD / OpenID Connect** based Single Sign-on, after a previous change always added 'https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read' to the scope / permissions being requested (v21.8). Now this permission will only be added, if the plugin detects a premium extension (because any premium extension needs this permission when it attempts to retrieve user data from Microsoft Graph) [LOGIN]
* Fix: The application ID / application ID URI for Azure AD based protection for the WordPress REST API must now also be added to the wp-config.php (but only if the administrator has enabled the option to use wp-config.php for Azure AD secrets). [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: The Microsoft Graph Mailer for WordPress no longer "unauthorizes" itself, after it fails to retrieve an access token. Instead, WPO365 Health Messages are created and administrators should regularly check for errors [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: Refactored the flow when sending emails from a different account than the one submitting the request to send an email to Microsoft Graph (= the default "From" account) to improve consistency, even when the alternative sending-from account is a Shared Mailbox, a Distribution List or Group or normal User Mailbox. [MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER, MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: **User synchronization** will now generate an error and stop when it fails to create a new WP Cron task for the next batch of users. [SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: Updated Teams SDK (used for silent SSO when integrating WordPress into Microsoft Teams). [LOGIN]
* Fix: Updated PowerBI SDK. [LOGIN, INTRANET, M365 APPS]

= v21.8 =
* Feature: Administrators can now enable **Mail Staging Mode**. This is useful for debugging and staging environments. WordPress emails will be logged and saved in the database instead of being sent. [MAIL]
* Improvement: The WPO365 plugin will now handle forms (e.g. Contact Form 7) that propose to send emails from a different account than the "default from" mail account, after it handles any other option (e.g Shared Mailbox or Send as / Send on behalf of). The proposed "alternative from" therefore always prevail. It can also be any type of mailbox e.g. User Mailbox, Shared Mailbox or Distributionlist. But it's up to the adminstrator to ensure that the "default from" mail account is a either a member (e.g. of the Shared Mailbox) or has sufficient permissions to send emails as / on behalf of an alternative account (e.g. the Distributionlist). [MAIL]
* Fix: The initial OpenID Connect authorization request will now always include https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read. [LOGIN]
* Fix: A public property $ErrorInfo has been added to the PHPMailer object to support integration with Gravity Forms. [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: The plugin now better understands - in the context of WordPress Multisite installations - whether the configuration must be retrieved / stored at site or at network level. [LOGIN]
* Fix: Some Azure AD information that the plugin collects during the plugin self-test is no longer assigned to the user executing the self-test. [LOGIN]

= v21.7 =
* Fix: ID Token validation now also validates audiences that are defined using an Application ID URI instead of the Application ID (e.g. this is the case for Microsoft Teams). [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: The plugin does no longer rely on the HTTP_HOST key of the global $_SERVER variable, which - if not initialized - may cause a critical error on the website. [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: The link to launch the Mail Log Viewer would return "false" for FireFox users. [MAIL]

= v21.6 =
* Improvement: The (premium extension for the) *Microsoft Graph Mailer for WordPress* now also supports sending mail as / on behalf of another user or distribution list. [MAIL]
* Improvement: The user interface for the *Mail Log Viewer* has been significantly updated with improved scrolling and selection and overall a clearer arrangement of the available information. [MAIL]
* Improvement: The *Microsoft Graph Mailer for WordPress* will notify the administrator in the form of a WPO365 Health Message when another plugin with mail-sending capabilities is detected. [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: An alternative system for *WordPress Nonces* has been introduced to work around the fact that some browsers refuse to send the WordPress auth cookie along with HTTP 302 redirect requests, causing default WordPress nonce verification to fail unexpectedly, in which case the plugin would then log the warning "Could not successfully validate oidc nonce with value xyz". [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]

= v21.5 =
* Fix: The recently added *ID token verification* did not take the mail-authorization flow into account. [LOGIN]
* Improvement: Administrators can now re-configure the WPO365 | LOGIN plugin to skip the *ID token verification* altogether, on the plugin's *Miscellaneous* configuration page (but this is not recommended for production environments). [LOGIN]

= v21.4 =
* Fix: The built-in update checker for premium extensions might incorrectly indicate that an update for some extensions would be available. [LOGIN]

= v21.3 =
* Fix: The plugin would cause a fatal crash when using PHP 7.2 or lower. [ALL]

= v21.2 =
* Change: The WPO365 | LOGIN plugin will now verify the tenant that issued the ID token and the audience for which the ID token was issued. [LOGIN]
* Fix: Various issues with the built-in license and update checker for premium extensions and bundles.
* Fix: The Employee Directory app now will only take the host portion of the SharePoint home URL when dynamically constructing the permissions scope. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Fix: The User Sync test case will skip the check for custom domains when Azure AD B2C has been selected. [SYNC, INTRANET]

= v21.1 =
* Fix: License check for premium extensions and bundles would show "unknown error occurred" for valid licenses.
* Fix: Update check for premium extensions and bundles now better aligned with the recently updated license management service.

= v21.0 =
* Improvement: Various aspects of user synchronization have been improved / refactored in an attempt to make it easier to configure, track and start / stop jobs. [SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: The WPO365 plugin will now - by default - first try to look up an existing WordPress user by its Azure AD Object ID. This value uniquely identifies a user in Azure AD and is automatically configured when WPO365 creates a new user (or updates an existing one). [ALL]
* Improvement: To support Azure AD B2C user synchronization, newly created user synchronization jobs will now - by default - skip the domain check (whereby the login domain of the username of users retrieved from Microsoft Graph is matched against a list of supported custom domains on the plugin's *User registration* configuration page). Existing user synchronization jobs must be updated manually. [SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: If WPO365 User synchronization has been configured, the default WordPress User list will be enhanced automatically. A column is added to show the date and time a user was last updated by WPO365 User synchronization. A second column will show a button that allows administrators to reactivate a user in case that user has been de-activated / soft-deleted by WPO365 User synchronization. [SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Support for Azure AD B2C custom login domains. See [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/167-use-custom-domain-for-b2c-login) for details. [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Administrators can now configure website buttons targetting a specific Azure AD B2C user flow or custom policy sign-up, sign-in or reset password. See [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/168-allow-multiple-b2c-policies) for details. [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: It is now possible to configure an embedded login experience for Azure AD B2C. See [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/170-azure-ad-b2c-embedded-login) for details. [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: The *Source for custom user fields* (ID token, Microsoft Graph or SAML response) selector was not always visible on the plugin's *User sync* configuration page. [LOGIN+, CUSTOMER USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: The *Allow forms to override "From" address* was only enabled for application-level *Mail.Send* permissions. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: Overriding the "From" address was sometimes ignored. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: Sending from a Shared Mailbox was sometimes ignored. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: Version bump for all WPO365 plugins. [ALL]
* Fix: License for premium extensions are now checked regularly and a notification will be shown if the license is expired. [ALL]
* Fix: The "Authorized!" label on the plugin's *Mail* configuration page is now green instead of red to indicate succes

= v20.4 =
* Fix: The mail authorization may falsely indicate that the plugin is not authorized to send emails using Microsoft Graph due to how the plugin compared permissions. [ALL]

= v20.3 =
* Feature: Websites that are using the [Mail Integration for Office 365/Outlook](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mail-integration-365/) are now urged to switch to [WPO365 | MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpo365-msgraphmailer/) or configure the builtin Microsoft Graph mail function of the WPO365 | LOGIN plugin. Consult the [online migration guide](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/165-migrate-from-mail-integration-for-office-365-outlook-to-wpo365-microsoft-graph-mailer) for further details. [ALL]
* Improvement: Administrators can check an option to **Use alternative CDN** (on the plugin's Integration page). If checked, the plugin will download the react-js and react-dom.js packages from the CloudFlare CDN (instead of from the default UNPKG CND). However, administrators can also choose to self-host these dependencies. In this case they can override the CDN configuration using a constant that must defined in wp-config.php. See the [online documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/163-use-alternative-cdn-for-javascript-libraries) for details. [ALL]
* Fix: The avatar method updated in v20.0 now also overrides the get_avatar hook to avoid conflicts with other plugins such as Ultimate Member. [AVATAR, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v20.2 =
* Improvement: Administrators can now define a constant in wp-config.php to override the default CDN used to download the react.js and react-dom.js packages. This constant must be defined immediately after the line "/* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */" as an array as follows: define('WPO_CDN', array('react' => 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.14.0/umd/react.production.min.js', 'react_dom' => 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.14.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js'));

= v20.1 =
* Fix: The renaming of an option (to allow retrieval of oauth tokens by client side apps) prevented existing configurations to update this value. [ALL]

= v20.0 =
* Feature: The (premium version of the) Microsoft Graph Mailer can now send attachments larger than 3 MB. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Feature: The (premium version of the) Microsoft Graph Mailer can now send emails from a Shared Mailbox. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: The LOGIN+ extension now also allows administrators to save multiple configurations (on the plugin's Import / Export configuration page). [LOGIN+]
* Improvement: Administrators can now define the name of the WordPress user meta for user attributes synchronized from Azure AD to WordPress. [LOGIN+, CUSTOM USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: The Avatar method now replaces the URL of the profile image instead (by filtering the pre_get_avatar_data function instead of the get_avatar function). [AVATAR, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Now supports reading custom claims in a SAML response and save them as WordPress user meta. [LOGIN+, CUSTOM USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Administrators can now choose to skip updating a user WordPress user's displayname. [LOGIN+, USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Some parts of the source code have been updated to improve compatibility with PHP 8.1. [ALL]
* Fix: The Audiences feature now also prevents access to posts and pages using a direct-edit link. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: Sign out of Microsoft now also works as expected for Azure AD B2C. [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: Custom formatting of a WordPress user's displayname now works as expected for SAML 2.0 based Single Sign-on. [LOGIN+, CUSTOM USER FIELDS SYNC, INTRANET]
* Fix: The shortcode properties of a Micrsoft 365 App are now HTML-decoded to handle the case where WordPress updates shortcode properties when an author edits a page. [ALL]
* Fix: The div that encapsulates a Microsoft 365 App can now be referenced by its unique classname "wpo365-app-root". [ALL]
* Fix: Some WPO365 options have been removed / renamed to avoid triggering ModSecurity OWASP CRS causing an 418 "I am not a teapot" HTTP errors, for example when hosting a site at DreamHost. [ALL]
* Fix: The plugin now correctly tries again to get a user's (Azure AD) group memberships with Group.Read.All permissions when the administrator has not (yet) granted permissions to do so using GroupMember.Read.All permissions. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v19.4 =
* Fix: Mail authorization for delegated access would fail with the error "Could not retrieve a tenant and application specific JSON Web Key Set and thus the JWT token cannot be verified successfully". [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: Embedded PowerBI reports will now try to refresh the acquired access token when the browser tab is left open. [LOGIN, INTRANET, M365 APPS]
* Fix: Encoding of parameters for embedded SharePoint Online apps (Search and Documents) have been improved. [LOGIN, INTRANET, M365 APPS]
* Fix: The Audiences custom meta box has been updated and produces valid HTML. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v19.3 =
